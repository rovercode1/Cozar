## Synopsis
This was created to improve mine (and others) workflow.
Instead of repeating the same base code i use in 90% of my projects,
I decided to *finally* create a sass template.

This was achevied by the help of **Bootstrap** and **sass**.
## Code Example
**base-section**- is used as a default section.
Using this inside of your main section will eliminate the fuss of adding the base of any section.
  **For example:**
<br>
`section class="custom-section"`
<br>
`div class="base-section"`
<br>
-----------section code here-----------
<br>

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.
